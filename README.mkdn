# NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::BundleInspector - Gather prereq and config info from PluginBundles

# VERSION

version 0.004

# SYNOPSIS

    ; in dist.ini
    [Bootstrap::lib]
    [BundleInspector]

# DESCRIPTION

This plugin is useful when using [Dist::Zilla](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla) to release
a plugin bundle for [Dist::Zilla](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla) or [Pod::Weaver](https://metacpan.org/pod/Pod::Weaver)
(others could be supported in the future).

Each bundle inspected will be loaded to gather the plugin specs.
**Note** that this means you will probably want to use
[Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Bootstrap::lib](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Bootstrap::lib)
in order to inspect the included bundle
(rather than an older, installed version).

This plugin does [Dist::Zilla::Role::PrereqSource](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Role::PrereqSource)
and the bundle's plugin specs will be used
to determine additional prereqs for the dist.

Additionally this plugin does [Dist::Zilla::Role::FileMunger](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Role::FileMunger)
so that if you include a line in the pod of your plugin bundle
of exactly `=bundle_ini_string` it will be replaced with
a verbatim block of the roughly equivalent INI config for the bundle.

# ATTRIBUTES

## bundle

Specify the name of a bundle to inspect.
